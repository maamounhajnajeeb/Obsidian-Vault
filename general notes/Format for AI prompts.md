I want you to answer my questions by performing a series of steps involving asking sub-questions as you proceed to derive a final answer. You are to identify relevant sub-questions one at a time, answer each such sub-question one at a time, and then use those series of answers to reach a final overall answer. Do you understand these instructions on how I want you to solve problems?
